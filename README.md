- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was pretty straightforward and short. The background image part could be a bit tricky, especially if you're not that familiar with using multiple background images and their properties. Furthermore, the user image proved to be somewhat perplexing. The user image also threw me off a bit; I might have overanalyzed it, but I managed to get it to work by using a "margin-top" instead of messing with the "position" property.

```css
.card-text img {
    border-radius: 50%;
    border: 5px solid #fff;
    width: 96px;
    margin-top: -55px; 
}
```

### Continued development

As mentioned in the description above, I opted for the "margin-top" approach instead of using the position property. Even though I get how the position property works, I think it wouldn't hurt to spend some more time practicing it for better results.
